### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob, and welcome to my Python learning journey repository. 

As someone who is transitioning into the tech field, I've created this space to document my progress, share projects, and connect with both the coding community and potential employers. 
My aim is to become proficient in Python, with a keen interest in data analysis, web development, and machine learning. 
If you're on a similar path, curious about my projects, or have insights to share I'd love to hear from you!
